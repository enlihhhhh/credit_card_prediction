## About
### Synopsis
We are a group of NTU students undertaking the task of predicting the Credit Card Approval for our SC1015 module Mini-Project (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). We have taken our dataset from kaggle, under the **'Credit Card Approval Prediction'** [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction).
### Problem Definition
Our team's objective is to distinguish the good clients from the bad clients based on the time taken for them to repay their loans. The risk is based on the time taken for them to repay their loans. We have defined the good clients and bad clients as follows:
> Good Clients
> - Impose a low risk on banks
> - Either no loans or able to repay their loans within 29 days

> Bad Clients
> - Impose a high risk on banks
> - Takes longer than 30 days to repay their loans or default on their loans
### Rationale
Our team's reason for choosing this particular dataset is as follows:
> Context
> - Usage of Credit card is extremely prevelant in today's day and age
> - However, given that credit is built on the system of trust, it is important for the banks to known which are the clients that impose a higher risk so that they can be highlighted

> Dataset
> - The dataset for the client's credit cartf approval is extremely exhaustive and delineate
> - Especially so as financial firms would collect as many information as possible to determine if the client impose a high risk
> - After all, the credit system is akin to a short term loan
